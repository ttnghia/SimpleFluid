# Simple Fluid Simulation using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)

* The program is implemented in Qt 5.9 framework.
* Multi-threading by Intel TBB libary.
* Skybox textures in folder Textures/Sky are automatically loaded at start up.
* Press Spacebar key to pause/resume the simulation.
* Press 'R' key to reset camera view.
* A Prebuild has been provided to run immediately.
* As my implementation depends on a lots of external libaries, the source code can only be compiled by me.
